# Style the entire project
# User Types the Encrypted Text to Decrypt
# Decrypt the input text by replacing each encrypted character with its original vowel
# Replace "*" with "a"
# Replace "&" with "e"
# Replace "#" with "i"
# Replace "+" with "o"
# Replace "!" with "u"
# Print the decrypted text
# Put it in a loop so the user can try to Decrypt again
